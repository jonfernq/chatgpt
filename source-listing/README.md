Write a Python program for Windows to traverse all subdirectories from a directory and write to a file all the JavaScript and HTML source code files if finds.  [Note: Minor changes in code below to make it work correctly]

Certainly! Here is a Python program that will accomplish this task:
```
import os

def find_files(suffix, path):
    """
    Find all files beneath path with file name suffix.

    Note that a path may contain further subdirectories
    and those subdirectories may also contain further subdirectories.

    There are no limit to the depth of the subdirectories can be.

    Args:
      suffix(str): suffix if the file name to be found
      path(str): path of the file system

    Returns:
       a list of paths
    """
    if not os.path.exists(path):
        return []
    if not os.path.isdir(path):
        return []

    files = []
    for subdir, _, filenames in os.walk(path):
        for filename in filenames:
            if filename.endswith(suffix):
                files.append(os.path.join(subdir, filename))

    return files
```
This program defines a function find_files that takes in a file suffix (e.g. ".html") and a path to a directory. It returns a list of all the file paths in the directory (and its subdirectories) that have the specified suffix.

The program also includes a main function with some test cases to demonstrate how the find_files function can be used.

To write the files to a file, you can simply open a file in write mode and iterate through the list of file paths returned by find_files, reading the contents of each file and writing it to the output file. Here is an example of how this could be done:
```
def write_to_file(suffix, path, output_file):
    files = find_files(suffix, path)
    with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
        for file in files:
            with open(file, 'r') as input_file:
                f.write(input_file.read())

write_to_file(".html", "./testdir", "output.txt")
```
This will write all the HTML files in the testdir directory (and its subdirectories) to the file output.txt. You can use a similar approach to write JavaScript files to the file by calling write_to_file with the suffix ".js".
```
def main():
    root = os.getcwd() 
    # Test cases
    print(find_files(".html", root))
    print(find_files(".js", root))
    print(find_files(".css", root))
    write_to_file(".js", root, "output.txt") 
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
